# AutoFinanceReport
This repository contains the output of an automated system that analyzes approximately 500 financial tickers and generates HTML reports.
Every weekend, the program runs automatically and performs different analysis depending on the day.
The reports are saved locally and published online via GitHub Pages for easy access.
No manual action is required: analysis, file generation, and publication are fully automated.
